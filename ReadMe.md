# Sample Smart Contract Audit Report
by Dorian Hryniewicki

#### Take a look at a sample phase one audit of a flattened smart contract file for a Token Exchange. The report is generated with the combination of manually testing the contract in a local environment, as well as using automated tools, which in this case includes MythX and Slither. The output of the analysis is included in the report, where you will find a mixture of Common Vulnerability Exploits, as well as additional information about the contract in regards to best practices and code quality.
